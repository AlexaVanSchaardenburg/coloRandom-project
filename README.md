# coloRandom-project

## Project Summary

This interactive website allows users to randomly generate their own color palette without repeats. The user also has the option to save the color palette by clicking the 'save palette' option. They can view their saved palettes to the right of the screen. The user can lock or unlock specific colors in the generated palettes on the main page, allowing for full customization. The user can delete any saved palettes on the right of the screen, but will be alerted to ensure that they did not do this on accident. In the saved palettes area, the user can click on a previously saved palette and re-edit if they desire. A final addition is a cursor feature, where if they user moves the cursor over a part of the website, it changes to let them know they can click on said feature.

## Learning Goals
The learning goals of this project were to:
- Write semantic HTML and efficient CSS to form a usable UI
- Write clean, DRY JavaScript and leverage functions, creating and using an effective data model
- Manipulate the page after it has loaded adding, removing, and updating elements on the DOM
- Refine your collaboration skills

## Wins and Challenges
### Wins:
As a group we worked really well together both through independent group, task delegation and pair programming. The even balancing of these three elements allowed us to finish the project three days ahead of the deadline and complete an additional three features beyond the project spec. 

### Challenges:
While we were building functionality to save palettes and delete palettes we struggled to understand how we could target the correct elements in order to display them in the saved section. We also needed to better understand how to use a target id to delete the correct palette. During this we worked strongly as a group to collaborate and share ideas. This allowed us to try several approaches simultaneously and then combine them into one working solution.
