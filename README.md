# coloRandom-project

## Project Summary

- This interactive website allows users to randomly generate their own color palette without repeats. The user also has the option to save the color palette by clicking the 'save palette' option. They can view their saved palettes to the right of the screen. The user can lock or unlock specific colors in the generated palettes on the main page, allowing for full customization. The user can delete any saved palettes on the right of the screen, but will be alerted to ensure that they did not do this on accident. In the saved palettes area, the user can click on a previously saved palette and re-edit if they desire. A final addition is a cursor feature, where if they user moves the cursor over a part of the website, it changes to let them know they can click on said feature.
